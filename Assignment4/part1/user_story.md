Service: Sign up

As a user, I can choose to sign up with my email for personal or business uses, so that I can send, spend, and manage my money if I choose to have a personal account, or that I can get paid online or in store and collect donations for my business growth. 

Acceptance Criteria:

1. When the user clicks the solid blue "Sign up" button in the top right corner, the signup page will appear with two options in separate boxes. The left box contains the "Personal" choice, while the right one contains the "Business" choice. Both have purposes and benefits related to their respective account types.

2. On the select account type page, the default choice is "Personal," but the user can switch to "Business" by clicking the solid blue "Get Started" button below the two choice boxes to proceed to the next step of signing up.

3. After the user select an account type and proceed to the next step, the user can enter their email address and click the solid blue "Next" button below the input field.

4. When entering the email address, if the email address already exists in the database, the "Welcome back!" page will pop up and provide the user with recommendations to "Log in," "Forgot Password," or "Sign up with a different email" for the next step.

5. When entering the email address, if the email address does not exist in the database, the user will be prompted to provide their phone number on a new page. The solid blue "Next" button below the input field should be provided to move to the next step.

6. After user enters their phone number, a "Confirm your phone" page will pop up, allowing the user to enter the code sent to the provided phone number. The user can also choose to resend the code if they did not receive it as a text message or opt to receive a code via a phone call. 

7. When confirming the phone number, after entering the code, the page will automatically redirect to the "Create a password" page, where the user can set a unique password for their account. An eye icon on the right side of the input field allows the user to view the password while typing. Password requirements should be listed, and a solid blue "Next" button should be provided.

8. After the password is created, a "Personal info" page will appear, requesting the user's legal first and last names and address. The user should also have the option to check a box confirming that they are at least 18 years old and have agreed to the listed terms. After completing these fields, the user can click the solid blue "Agree and Create Account" button to finalize their account creation for their intended purpose.

9. At any step, if the user does not fill in a required field and leaves it empty, and no default value is given, a warning message should appear stating "XXX is required." The page should not redirect if the user fails to meet the current page's requirements.
