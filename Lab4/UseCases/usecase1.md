# Use Case 1

<hr>

**Use Case**: Window and Drawable Canvas Size

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To setup the window and drawable canvas with size 600x400 (600 pixels wide, 400 pixels high).

**Preconditions**: The program must be started and running. 

**Trigger**: Double click the program icon to start the program.
  
**Scenario**: A user will open the program and a canvas with size 600x400 will be ready for the user to paint on. 
 
**Exceptions**: (1) The program may not be opened after clicking the icon. In this case, try to delete and re-install the program. (2) The canvas might be bigger than the screen size. In this case, switch to a screen with more pixels.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: N/A

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We might need to use relative size instead of hardcode the 600x400 in the future to make sure that the canvas could be used in any screen size with more or less pixels.
